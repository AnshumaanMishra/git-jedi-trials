My favorite pokemon is Alakazam as it can sweep through any gym and is available fairly early in most mainline Pokemon Games. Also, spoons go brrrrrr.

I would also like to take my time warning people against the Gengar Propaganda. Just because you have a large tongue does not mean youcan eat Ice Creams faster. Alakazam has up to 5 spoons. Beware, stay safe.
